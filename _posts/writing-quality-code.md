We all love to be called coders 👩‍💻. But as one great man once said "*with great power comes great responsibility*" 🕷, poorly written code can result in a disasters of small to catastrophic proportions. For example,

- **Space: Ariane 5** - On June 4 1996, A bug in the control software of the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket, caused the rocket to self-destruct 37 seconds after blast-off.
- **MySpace** - An unfortunate disaster recovery failure.
- **AT&T** - Lost tens of millions because of a misplaced break statement.

The list can go on and on... 

I want to help you with what you need to do to write better code. Before we start I want to tell you a mantra,

> ### Prevention is better than cure 

Most of the time we are running on a deadline and because of the we tend to always be in a hurry.
The result, a big ball of mud 🤯, the fast and dirty code.

The ideal way of development is to divide a module into multiple phases and follow an incremental process to complete the whole module. Taking each phase one at a time will help you find all the loopholes and breakage in the code and fix them before you can move on to the next phase.

In this process we will come up with a lot of bug, we will go back and fix them, so ultimately getting the work done takes longer. But this act of prevention will turn out be a lot more efficient in the long run.

Now, Lets get started 👨‍💻

## 1. Take responsibility of your code
The quality of the code you write is your responsibility. Not your manager or client's.
