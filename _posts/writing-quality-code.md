We all love to be called coders 👩‍💻. But as one great man once said "*with great power comes great responsibility*" 🕷, poorly written code can result in a disasters of small to catastrophic proportions. For example,

- **Space: Ariane 5** - On June 4 1996, A bug in the control software of the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket, caused the rocket to self-destruct 37 seconds after blast-off.
- **MySpace** - An unfortunate disaster recovery failure.
- **AT&T** - Lost tens of millions because of a misplaced break statement.

The list can go on and on... 

I want to help you with what you need to write better code. Lets get started,

> ### Prevention is better than cure 

Most of the time we are running on a deadline. Be it your manager or a client, they will always want you to deliver in a tight schedule. So what do you do ? you work your a** off, sacrifice your weekends and deliver your code by the deadline.
The result, a big ball of mud 🤯, the fast and dirty code.

What if we actually go slower ? We will have sufficient time to find all the bugs and fix them in the development phase.
The ideal way is to divide a module into multiple phases and follow an incremental process to complete the whole module. Taking each phase one at a time will help you find all the loopholes and breakage in the code and fix them before you can move on to the next phase.

In this process we will come up with a lot of bug, we will have to go back and fix them, we will find needles in the haystack, so ultimately getting the work done takes longer. But this act of prevention can cause a lot better than the cure.
